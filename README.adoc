= Relational Resources Language
RRL is an experimental -natural alike- language that should help creating digital artifacts by relating publicly available resources.

The following example should produce a canvas based image:

```    
    get canvas from system

    get blue_sky from image_gallery/backgrounds # Not implemented yet
    get banana, orange from image_gallery/fruits # Not implemented yet
   
    place blue_sky on canvas # Not implemented yet
    place banana on blue_sky # Not implemented yet
``` 

== Providers
This initial work contains only the _system_ provider, with a canvas provider skeleton (using pygame).
Documentation for providers can be found at  link:doc/RESOURCES.adoc[Resources] .

=== Examples
You can run the examples from the source dir without installing the package with:
```
python -m rrl run examples/canvas.rrl
```
